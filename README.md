# The PokeDen
The PokeDen is a collaborative project between 3 developers: Aaron Arguelles, Zach Robles, and Joshua Juarez. The website showcases our skills in React to make a frontend website which sends requests to a Pokemon API for data. The website is intended to allow users to search for any and all of the current pokemon and information on them.

# Currently in the Development Stage
We are still working on the website, however, it is deployed and you can view and test it out at https://pokeden.onrender.com

# Tools and Technology
